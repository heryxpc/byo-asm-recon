# byo-asm-recon
Workshop that shows how to build your own ASM recon on external and cloud assets. Presented at HackGDL 2024 by @heryxpc

## Instructions
You can use any domain or AWS account you are authorized to perform reconnaissance.
I used [CloudGoat](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat) as it worked smoothly to spin up AWS resources with interesting characteristics, specially when setting the `whitelist.txt` to `0.0.0.0/0`
‚ö†Ô∏è CloudGoat is a vulnerable by design project and spinning it on a production environment puts in risk the AWS account where it's hosted.‚ö†Ô∏è


## Demos
Each demo can be executed independently and has it's own requirements. You can check the details for each at:
* [External Attack Surface Management](./easm/README.md)
    * Querying domains with Shodan
    * Running EasyASM to discover new subdomains
    * Running sub.Monitor to discover new subdomains
* [Cloud Security Posture/Cloud Attack Surface](./cloudasm/README.md)
    * Building Cloud Security Dashboards with CloudQuery and Grafana
    * Building Attack Surface Investigation dashboards with Cartography and NeoDash
